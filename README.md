# trillstore
A tvOS app written in swiftUI for tvOS 15.0+ for purposes of testing CoreTrust. It has six functions.
1. "install cydia". It displays a loading circle for 5 seconds, then shows an alert when you press it.
2. "install sileo". It shows an alert when you press it.
3. "install trollstore". It exits the app when you press it.
4. "respring apple TV". Does just that, resprings your apple TV.
5. "panic apple TV". Doesn't do anything yet, but I'm working on figuring out how to make it work.
6. "go to the movies". Shows a list of movies that are shipped with the app. It ships with 2 by default.

Media player has quite a few functions.
1. Reset to beginning of video
2. Rewind (1x only)
3. Play/pause
4. Fast forward (2x only)
5. Skip back 10 seconds
6. Skip forward 10 seconds (doesn't always work not sure why)
7. Softlock app in an alert loop

Have fun ig

edit: you'll probably have to do some modifications to Build Phases to get the videos to work. Yes, you can view the full list of videos I use. do I care? no
